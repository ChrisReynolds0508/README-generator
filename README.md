# README-generator

## Description
This application is called README Generator.  This application is a command line app used to create a README file using Node.js.  

## Installation
The user must have Node.js installed on their local machine in order to run this application. 

## Usage
To run the program the user must open the develop directory in an integrated command line terminal.  Once the correct file path is opened in the command line, the user will run the command 
'Node index.js' and press enter.  The user will be met with a series of prompts in the terminal that will ask the user the title of their application, description, usage, licensing, contributing developers to the project, how to test the project, your github username, and email address.  After all questions are answered, a README file will be rendered in the current file path.
